        <p>The Imagineering Expo is a celebration of creative engineering 
            and innovation in experiential design. This event explores how 
            engineers, storytellers, and designers come together to build 
            immersive, interactive experiences that inspire wonder and bring 
            ideas to life. From robotics and ride systems to themed environments
             and emerging technologies, the expo showcases how imagination and 
             technical skill can create powerful connections with people of all
              ages. Attendees will discover how fields like mechanical engineering, 
              computer science, architecture, marketing, and media can work together
               to shape the future of entertainment, education, and community impact. 
               Whether you're a future engineer, creative thinker, or storyteller, the 
               Imagineering Expo invites you to explore what happens when you combine
                innovation with imagination — and design with heart.</p>
